# archlinux-fde-uefi
A collection of brief guides for installing Arch Linux with LUKS full disk encryption over a UEFI based system.

### What's this?
While I was further exploring the linux universe seeking the answer to the meaning of life, I met a challenge of never matched difficulty: full disk encryption using LUKS over a UEFI based system. Many are the guides available on the web but none of them fullfilled my thirst for knowledge, as some were for older non-GPT installs or a bit too vague for a first time approach of the argument. Therefore, here I share with you what I've learned during my journey... BTRFS as well!

### Available guides
* **LVM over LUKS** if you prefer a standard install using well tested and stable tools.
* **BTRFS over LUKS** if you're in the mood of exploring uncharted worlds.
